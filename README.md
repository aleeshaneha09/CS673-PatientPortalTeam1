## About The Project - Vision

UI/UX - This product is mainly concentrating on User Interface of the patient communication portal, which user can login and check the dashboard with lot of information like appointment scheduler, account summary, personal health records, demographic information, message center and lab reports making it easier for the patient to access everything online. This is to help patients to access and check in to the clinic digitally and to help people who cannot visit the clinic physically.

## Far Vision

Our goal is make sure we meet the following requirements for the client: Exchange secure messages. Request appointments, prescriptions and refills. Access always up-to-date personal healthcare records (PHR) including medications, lab results, diagnoses, care plans, immunization histories, and more. Quick access to additional healthcare information and educational material related to their diagnosis. Receive automated reminders, alerts, HIPAA compliance notices, and other important announcements. View statements and make payments. Our patient portal facilitates meaningful compliance. Easy setup- simply enter patient email and enable portal. An invitation email with instructions to your patients is automatically sent out.

## Near Vision

We will be working towards having a portal that is connected to the database which shows the up-to-date personal healthcare records (PHR) including medications, lab results, diagnoses, care plans, immunization histories, and more.

She has quite a lot of health problems and she sees her physician once in every 2 months, for follow-up on her medication, BP, Diabetes and so on. Her doctor always asks her not to have her favorite foods, but she refuses to listen. She feels bad about the fact that she doesn’t listen, so she takes alternative medicines for the same. She has never used a computer, she has a cell phone, but only uses it for calling. She is weirdly afraid of computers/electronics in general.

1. **_Insurance Company_** - Insurance Companies are often viewed as the enemy, who is only caring about making money and their stock price. XYZ, the insurance company executive feels that people don't realize how much healthcare actually costs, and that consumers need to be more actively involved like they are in the other areas of their life. The goal is to provide patients with the healthcare they need while avoiding excessive tests and high-cost drugs when lower-cost alternatives are available. XYZ emphasizes innovative shared-risk payment models but is slow to adapt to changes like precision medicine. It works with multiple clearinghouses and is affiliated with a mail-order pharmacy. It is considering buying physician's practices.

She gets a lot of personal satisfaction from having long-term relationships with patients, who appreciated the personalized care she provides. She spent 11 years in higher education and remains in debt to this day. She is often frustrated by how many complex documents need to be created to maximize billing, despite the fact that the same information must be displayed in a way that is relevant and clear when used to work up as a patient.
